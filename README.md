## 📌 Problem Statement

XYZ College previously managed prospective student inquiries across scattered Excel files, personal WhatsApp chats, and disconnected email inboxes. This led to:

- **Duplicate Records:** Multiple counsellors contacting the same student with conflicting information.
- **Missed Follow-Ups:** Inquiries going cold due to lack of scheduled reminders and SLA tracking.
- **No Shared Communication History:** Context was lost when leads transferred between counsellors.
- **Zero Team Visibility:** Admissions leadership had no real-time metrics on source ROI, conversion ratios, or individual counsellor workloads.

**Solution:** A unified admissions CRM providing instant search, combinable multi-criteria filtering, duplicate warning modals, sequential status pipelines, chronological activity timelines, real-time Recharts visualizations, and strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend & API** | **Next.js 14 (App Router)** + TypeScript | Unified React full-stack framework with server components and edge/node API routes. |
| **Styling & Design** | **Tailwind CSS** + Lucide React | High-density admissions UI with curated color tokens, glassmorphism, and responsive layouts. |
| **Database & ORM** | **PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM** | PostgreSQL is the active local and production backend, with an optional Prisma provider switch for SQLite compatibility checks. |
| **Authentication & RBAC** | **JWT Session (jose) + HTTP-only cookies + bcryptjs** | Secure multi-role authentication (`ADMIN` vs `MEMBER`) enforced at both the API and UI layers. |
| **Data Validation** | **Zod** | Schema validation with specific inline error handling and duplicate detection. |
| **Visualizations** | **Recharts** | Real-time interactive charts for monthly inflow, pipeline distribution, channel ROI, and team performance. |

## 🏛 Database Schema

The database model is defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](file:///./prisma/schema.prisma):

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ LEAD : "assigned to"
    USER ||--o{ ACTIVITY : "logged by"
    LEAD ||--o{ ACTIVITY : "interaction history"

    USER {
        string id PK
        string name
        string email UK
        string passwordHash
        string role "ADMIN | MEMBER"
        string department
        datetime createdAt
    }

    LEAD {
        string id PK
        string name
        string email
        string phone
        string college
        string course
        int gradYear
        string city
        string source
        string status "New | Contacted | Interested | Follow_up | Converted | Lost"
        datetime nextFollowUpDate
        string notes
        string assignedToId FK
        datetime createdAt
    }

    ACTIVITY {
        string id PK
        string leadId FK
        string type "Call | WhatsApp | Email | Meeting | Follow_up"
        datetime date
        string notes
        string nextAction
        string createdById FK
        datetime createdAt
    }
```

## ⚡ Quickstart & Local Setup (< 2 Minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (Node 20+ or 24 recommended)
- **npm** 9+

### 2. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupmazumdar/CRM-Project.git
cd CRM-Project
npm install
```

### 3. Configure PostgreSQL

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to your PostgreSQL connection string. For local PostgreSQL, the default development value is:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/college_crm?schema=public"
```

For Neon or another hosted provider, use its pooled connection string for the running app and a direct connection string when applying migrations.

### 4. Initialize Database & Seed Demo Data

```bash
# Push the Prisma schema to PostgreSQL
npm run db:push

# Seed with 40+ realistic leads, 4 users, and chronological activity timelines
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Launch the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🧪 Automated Test Suite

Run the end-to-end test suite verifying all 13 core requirements:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-e2e.ts
```

---

## 🛡 Security & Edge Hardening

- **Strict API RBAC:** Team Members cannot access or modify unassigned leads by guessing URLs or querying API routes directly.
- **Edge-compatible JWT:** Token verification runs in Edge middleware without pulling Node-specific binaries.
- **Sanitized Inputs & Zod Validation:** Inline errors for malformed emails, invalid phone lengths, past follow-up dates on new leads.

## 🌐 Production Deployment (Vercel & PostgreSQL)

The CRM is architected to run seamlessly on **Vercel** with a managed cloud PostgreSQL database (such as [Neon](https://neon.tech), [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or AWS RDS).

### 1. Configure for PostgreSQL

Run the automated provider switch script:

```bash
npm run db:use:postgres
```

*(To switch back to local SQLite at any time, simply run `npm run db:use:sqlite`)*

### 2. Setup Cloud PostgreSQL Database (e.g. Neon)

1. Sign up for free at [Neon](https://neon.tech) and create a project (e.g. `college-crm`).
2. Copy your pooled connection string (with `?sslmode=require`).

### 3. Push Database Schema & Seed Data

In your terminal, set your remote `DATABASE_URL` and run:

```bash
# Push schema tables to your cloud PostgreSQL database
npx prisma db push

# (Optional) Seed realistic college demo data
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your repository to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. In [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com), click **Add New Project** and import `CRM-Project`.
3. Under **Environment Variables**, add:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: `postgres://username:password@ep-xyz.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure random string (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_DEMO_LOGINS`: `true` (set to `false` for strict production mode)
4. Click **Deploy**! Vercel automatically runs `postinstall: prisma generate` and `next build`.
